## Introduction

This feature involves migrating the nail artist website from DaisyUI to a more modern, professional UI framework that provides better theming capabilities, easier styling, and more sophisticated component options.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN migrating components THEN all existing functionality SHALL be preserved
2. WHEN updating styling THEN the visual hierarchy and layout SHALL remain consistent or improve
3. WHEN replacing DaisyUI components THEN equivalent or better components SHALL be implemented
4. IF custom animations exist THEN they SHALL be preserved or enhanced in the new framework

### Requirement 5
